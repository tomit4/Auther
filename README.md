## Vite + Vue + NGINX

### Introduction

This simple project is simply an experimentation in how Vue-Router's Page
Routing Logic, Brevo's Transacitonal Email API, and also NGINX interact. The
plan is to eventually expand this out as a scaffolding for a project
incorporating login via logic involving jwt, trasac email, redis caching, and
db storage via mariadb.

#### The Why

As a beginner web developer, putting things into actual development is sometimes
a mystery. With services like Github Pages, Netlify, and many others, it
sometimes can seem like we simply push our development code up to a magic place
in the cloud, and voil√†, our site is live on the internet!

I've endeavored to dive just a tiny bit deeper and host my sites on my own VPS.
At the time of this writing (12/06/2023), I have only deployed a basic node
backend via docker and nginx, as well as a simple blog website written in HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript also served via docker and nginx.

While I have played around with VueJS and ReactJS in development, I have not
actually released a production application in either Framework, and it occurred
to me that routing might have some caveats since NGINX looks directly for files
in various directories when working with a traditional HTML/CSS/JS website.

This proved not to be too difficult, as it required a single line in the NGINX
config to resolve the issue. This might not be worth writing extensively about,
but nevertheless I am committing this small repository as a good starting point
for a simple project.

#### The What

This project provides a one step Onboarding Form that simply asks for an email.
Once the email is entered, it is sent back to a simple HapiJS server which
utilizes the Brevo Transactional Email API to send an email (template set up
directly on Brevo's website, requires API key and writing a simple
template with a button that sends via a parameter called {{params.link}}.

This email, if received and properly formatted via their online interface,
should lead the user back to the the application with a simple confirmation that
they've answered the email and "been verified" (currently no authentication,
authorization, or verification is actually implemented).

#### Installation

**Development**

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone "https://github.com/tomit4/vite_via_nginx"
```

2. Install all packages via npm

```
cd vite_via_nginx/backend && npm install && cd ../frontend && npm install
```

3. Edit your .env files. Provided within both the frontend and backend
   directories are some sample env files which you should copy and edit
   according to which ports you wish to use for the backend as well as
   environment variables central to interacting with the Brevo API.

4. Once installed, start each server, usually done through two different
   terminal windows:

```
# backend
npm run start
```

```
# frontend
npm run dev
```

4.  Navigate To The Onboarding Site in your browser(default vite port): localhost:5173/onboarding

5.  Fill out the Email form.

6.  Check your Email Inbox, if you filled out your Brevo API keys, as well as
    created the template on their website correctly, you should receive an email
    with a button with a simple call to action. Click the link/button.

You should now be returned to the application page confirming you've fulfilled
the transactional email request.

**Production**

I have provided a sample nginx.conf in the root directory of the project under
the config directory. This is a bare minimum nginx.conf that should not actually
be used in production, but will work as an example for what to append to your
hopefully more extensive nginx.conf you already have.

Of particular importance is the line:

```
try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
```

This is taken directly from the Vue-Router website. To get this working on
NGINX, you of course, must have NGINX installed on your development machine. I
personally work on an Arch Linux based distribution, so while the pathnames may be a
bit different, the concepts around NGINX remain similar between Linux
distributions. Consult your specific distros documentation on NGINX to find where
your default nginx.conf files exist.

On Arch Linux, those files can be found in /etc/nginx. There you will find a
default nginx.conf file. Navigate there and make a backup of the default, we
will be replacing it for the purposes of this demonstration:

```
cp nginx.conf nginx.conf.bak
```

Next copy the sample nginx.conf provided with this project to your /etc/nginx/
directory.

```
cp vite_via_nginx/config/config/nginx_example.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Finally restart nginx so that it will load this new configuration file:

```
systemctl restart nginx
```

Navigate to the port specified within the nginx_example.conf (now your
nginx.conf) and you should see the home screen. Navigate to the onboarding route
and follow the steps above in the Development section to ensure everything is
working as expected.

### Conclusion

While this is essentially a trivial application meant solely to demonstrate how
to set up Vue-Router with NGINX in production, as well as with the added nicety
of interacting with the Brevo Transactional Email API, I felt it was worthwhile
to document this simple project as it might prove useful to myself (and possibly
others) in the future when starting out on a basic project that utilizes
these tools.

### UPDATE AS OF 01/03/2024

Since setting up this repository as a simple demonstration of how to set up
vite/nginx/vue-router within docker, I have since used it to scaffold a project
that demonstrates the very basics of Login/Authentication. As of the writing of
this section, this now includes Sign Up, Login, Logout, Change Password, Delete
Profile, and Forgot Password features. It's a little rough around the edges, but
it is a good starting point for a beginner like myself.

The backend is more or less done (although a second refactor would be helpful as
there is still some repeated code and poor naming conventions,
especially in the forgot password routes).

The frontend needs to incorporate zod verification to further protect the
backend routes.

Additionally, AppView still has a TODO that specifies making a
section of its View its own component.

This entire project requires its directory structure to be further organized,
as it only encapsulates the Authentication part of the application, and will
get messy should an actual application be utilized behind the Login Page (which
is the plan).

Once these refactors are done, we'll need to write unit tests on the backend
using Ava, and some sort of E2E testing utilizing Vitest (and possibly other
libraries I am as of this writing only vaguely familiar with).

After that, setting up a series of Virtualized Docker Environments within a
Docker Network will be necessary to set this up as a POC on Linode (utilize one
of your free Domains, set it up with HTTPS/SSL/LetsEncrypt/Certbot/NGINX).

Finally, once this POC of just basic login is done, utilize it in one of your
main portfolio pieces. Ensure that all accounts are wiped clean on a cronjob as
the likelihood of this being an insecure form of authentication is high and is
only for learning purporses (make this clear to the user in an About section).

**TODOS**

- [x] Convert project over to typescript as practice
- [x] Investigate caching (i.e.redis)
- [x] Set up knex/postgresql following [this tutorial](https://www.basedash.com/blog/how-to-configure-knex-js-with-typescript)
- [x] Incorporate postgresql with knex query builder for very basic db integration,
      allow for secure storage of hashed email addresses and associated usernames,
      dates of sign up, etc.
- [x] Expand example to include jsonwebtoken/login demonstration
- [ ] Dockerize the backend fastify/redis/knex/postgresql as one docker
      container (not going to be easy)

**SIGNUP LOGIC**

- Once the user has entered their email and password,
  A unique hash token representing their temporary credentials is established in
  redis, this stores a hash of their email as well as their password encrypted
  using bcrypt. This has an expiration time of a few hours (up to 24 hours or so).

- The transactional email using Brevo holds a variable known as params.link, which
  should send them back to our application url with the same hash email in the
  url.

- Upon arrival back at the application at this specified url, the hash is sent to
  the backend where it is checked against the redis store.

- If the hash exists, a jwt is established, that jwt is hashed and then sent back
  as a cookie to the client in the headers to be used as a login (this is
  indicative of how login will be covered as well). Additionally,
  the user's hashed email and encrypted password is then stored in the SQL
  database (either mariadb or postgresql) for future logins.
