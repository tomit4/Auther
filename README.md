## Vite + Vue + NGINX

### Introduction

This simple project is simply an experimentation in how Vue-Router's Page Routing Logic, Brevo's Transacitonal Email API, and also NGINX interact. This repository will be utilized temporary on a personal Linod server for research and prototyping purposes.

:construction: **this repository is currently under construction**

**TODO**:

- [ ] Copy NGINX config here, remove sensitive and not necessary details.
- [ ] Write up docs on how to configure locally via nginx.
- [ ] Deploy to Linode to test in the wild.
